## Inspiration
When we say that this year's theme was transportation, we really wanted to build a game using an aquatic and air vehicle. As we started brainstorming with those in mind, we came up with the ideas for these levels.

## What it does
There are two levels with their own objectives to complete. The first is a plane level where you are flying through the sky trying to collect the Panera Bread before the birds snatch it up. The second is in deep sea where you control a submarine that uses its spotlight to find H&R Blocks. 

## How we built it
On this project we used the Unity engine along with C# scripts made in Visual Studios to control our assets and sprites. 

## Challenges we ran into
One of the hardest challenges was figuring out how to create a win objective. While we were able to create our levels and models with relative ease, when it came time to wrap up the project we struggled to adequately finish everything up.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of our Sprites and Models. Our team member Blaise, a Senior Graphic Design major, really invested his time and resources during this competition to complete stunning pixel art.

## What we learned
This was most of our team's first time going in-depth with Unity and trying to create a game. The whole process of making this project was a learning experience from figuring out how to operate the UI to programming in C#.

## What's next for Wings and Fins
Future steps for Wings and Fins includes adding more level with more transportation types and objectives. Also expanding on the level we have already made and improving them.
